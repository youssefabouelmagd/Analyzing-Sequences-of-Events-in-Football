# Analysing-Sequences-of-Events-in-Football
This is an MSc individual project for Data Science Analysing the sequences of events. 
The files in this main Branch are divided by competitions analysed in this project. Some codes are shorter than others because that competition was not analysed further, depending on which competition was used to answer research questions. The code in each file is organised by research questions. The only competition that was used to answer all questions was La Liga. Other files are just the same code applied to different data.
